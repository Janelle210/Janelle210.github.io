# About Me

I was born and raised in the beautiful area of Yakima, Washington where I get the pleasure of enjoying the views of Mt. Adams and Mt. Rainier from my home every day. I have been blessed with a wonderful, blended family and am so proud of our three amazing boys.  My passions include spending time with family, hiking, exercise (previously certified exercise trainer), playing video games, and my dog, Beni!

I've had various jobs growing up, but I've spent the last sixteen years a registered dental hygienist. I have leveraged scientific methodologies and data driven insights to revolutionize not only oral health but overall health for thousands of patients. I am now on a journey to combine my passion for uncovering actionable insights and data-driven strategies in a data analysis role. Through my pursuit of furthering my education, I have learned how to use my scientific mindset to collect, clean, and manipulate data effectively and can professionally communicate recommendations that will foster succes in any business.

For the past two years I have spent my time dedicated to furthering my skills in data analysis and I am now seeking opportunities to merge my tech expertise with a people-centric approach. Please feel free to explore my projects and my portfolio!
